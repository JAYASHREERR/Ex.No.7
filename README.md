# Aim:

To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT — to demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required:

Lovable App Builder 

# Explanation:

This experiment demonstrates the development of a Prompt-Based Personal Productivity Assistant using ChatGPT, which helps users manage their daily tasks, schedule events, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries in a natural and conversational way.
The assistant is adaptable and interacts using natural language, thereby simulating a real-life personal assistant capable of understanding context and preferences. The project emphasizes prompt engineering, where user queries are converted into structured tasks handled by an AI model.

# Prompt Used:

“Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.”

# Procedure:

Define the Core Requirements

Identify the main functions such as daily task management, scheduling, and wellness suggestions.

Ensure the assistant can respond naturally to user inputs.

Design the Prompts

Construct prompts for different use cases:

Adding new tasks

Generating schedules

Giving wellness tips

Handling general queries

Simulate Interaction

Use ChatGPT or a web app interface to simulate user–assistant communication.

Provide daily input like classes, tests, and free hours for schedule generation.

Adapt and Refine

Collect feedback and improve prompts to make the assistant more user-centered.

(Optional) Include simple memory or preference tracking features.

Generate and Record Output

Observe and record how the assistant interprets and organizes daily activities.

# Output:


# Example Chat Output:

# User Input:

“Today from 8–10 I have prompt engineering class. From 10–12 I am free; I will go for module exam hall to complete skill assessments. From 1–3 I am free; I will do REEP test. From 3–4 I have Introduction to MEMS NEMS class. This is my schedule for today, give me the whole schedule for me.”

# AI Assistant Response:

Got it, Niranjani! Let’s get your schedule all organized for today. Here’s how it looks:

8:00 AM – 10:00 AM: Prompt Engineering Class 📚

10:00 AM – 12:00 PM: Module Exam Hall – Complete Skill Assessments 🧾

1:00 PM – 3:00 PM: REEP Test ⏰

3:00 PM – 4:00 PM: Introduction to MEMS NEMS Class 💡

Looks like a productive day ahead! I’ve added these to your schedule. Let me know if anything changes or if you’d like to add more! 😊

# Result:

The lab exercise successfully demonstrated the creation of a Prompt-Based Personal Productivity Assistant using ChatGPT.

Students were able to:

Understand how to engineer and structure prompts for intelligent task automation.

Design creative, user-centric features tailored to personal or academic needs.

Learn how LLMs can simulate adaptive personal assistants.

Gain practical experience in applying AI tools for daily organization and productivity.

Hence, the experiment was successfully executed and achieved its objective. ✅
